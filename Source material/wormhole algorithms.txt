For a list of n campaigns:

each campaign starts with a 100/n slice to trigger
with each campaign completed, the size of the slice for others increase (to avoid replying campaigns)

i.e. the formula to trigger a campaign

((100/n) * campaign index) - 1 < random < (100/n) * (campaign index + 1)

with each campaign played, n is decreased by 1 and when it reaches 1 the last campaign is played with a special message

The campaign index starts at 0

To account for campaigns being removed, the effective campaign index is calculated as follows:

each finished campaign adds 2^their index to "Finished Campaigns" (exponentials done by branches + loops)
to get the effective campaign index, the remainder of "Finished Campaigns" / 2^index is used to identify which campaigns have been completed
if "Finished Campaigns" % index^2 - index-to-test > 0 then that campaign has been played (assuming that you go down the indexs in reverse order)
by counting the number of campaigns done with indexes less than the campaign index for the triggering mission, the effective index is found by: index - finished campaigns (indexes less than index)

by using apply nodes, information can be fed into a single conversation/function to do all the mathematics by using player conditions (which are wipped after the calculations to avoid save bloat)
