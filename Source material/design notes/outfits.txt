Weapons:

Foreshadow class beam-gun:
Long range, single firing turet mounted beam-gun that uses special single-use cartridges (ammo limit to stop it being too OP for their tech) to create a powerful (for them) penetrating beam with considerable damage to the hull (no shield damage at all though, but has 20 - 40% piercing) single most powerful weapon they have (range + piercing)
Pulse-torpedo launcher:
long range Phasing (in lore would have an advanced guidance system to weave around asteroids) + short range normal torpedo that deals little damage against hull but moderate damage to shields (shield breaker weapon on all their ships)
ion streamer:
Main Primary weapon of the starlus
similar to the heavy ion cyclotron but with slightly longer range and higher damage (and of course - is much bigger). Add a smidge of heat damage on top? (nope)

Neutron cannon + turret: (light weapon for the starlus)
Fires pulses of neutrons at a target, longer range than ion streamer but much less damage. high hit force and negligible shield damage

Light AM (model name pending):
Short range, low power, high fire rate AM (similar to korath warder, but less powerful per shot)

Heavy AM (model name pending):
Medium range, medium power, Medium fire rate AM (similar to PDT, but with more range and less power)

Shields:
?

Power:
? (non nuclear though)

Engines:

cooling:
Won't have dedicated cooling - high thermal mass due to them being full of water

Ammo:

Foreshadow energy cartridges

Special:
Starlus crew quarters - designed for npc use only to take place of below, to stop attributes falling below 0. No crew change, just to provide flavour and to keep NPCs running. Unplunderable.
Starlus -> Human conversion kit - For when they sell certain ships (never logistics - they're too important to them, plus they don't see the player as needing them) to lower crew requirement and bunks, and to provide a lore reason to why humans and use their ships. Unplunderable, and are attribute locked to the starlus ships (they can't be installed into other ships, else one attribute will be < 0, and can't be removed else a different attribute < 0)
