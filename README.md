# Starlus Plugin

A comprehensive content based plugin for Endless-Sky, focused around a tier 1.8 species located south of human space between Coalition space and the graveyard.

## Lore

The Starlus are a race of eel-like creatures predating humanity as a species, but their current system of governance has only been around since the human 17th century.
Their technology revolves around material sciences and chemical engineering giving them extremely good hull technology but little improvement over humanity for shield technology.

### Anatomy

The Starlus are eel-like in form, featuring a long thin body typically around 10 cm in diameter and up to a meter in length for adults.
Starluses are filter-feeders taking in both nutrients and oxygen using gill-like structures which they then absorb into their blood streams, waste products leave in a similar manner dissolving into the water and being fed back into the ecosystem. Because of this, a Starlus requires a constant source of nutrients in the water to survive.

Starluses can communicate to one another through vibrations in the water created via plates attached to their bellies near their front end, these vibrations can be heard by another up to a few hundred meters away depending on the strength of these vibrations.
Sensory organs include chemical receptors found inside their gills, sensitive pressure receptors throughout their skin and optical sensory organs situated at their front end.

Unlike humans who see light ranging from around 420 nm to 630 nm in wavelength, Starluses can perceive light from around 570 nm to 800 nm in wavelength. This allows them to see colors ranging from green into the near infrared which are of greater use underwater.
Their main senses though are that of pressure, as it helps them navigate dark areas underwater and provides information in a 360 degree arc compared to their 54 degree arc of vision. It also serves to provide information about their physical environment allowing them to locate regions where food is plentiful.

Finally, Starluses have the ability to secrete various chemicals, many of which can harden into solid layers, this allows them to construct solid tools that they can use to better interact with their environment. Other methods of manipulating their environment includes recessed plates on near their fronts with high coefficients of friction allowing them to push at various items.

### Social Structure

The Starlus governance system is technocratic, but with some degree of freedom for individuals allowing them to chose which field to specialize in and also how they manage their allocated hours of recapitulation.
Each Starlus works within its chosen field of work, but they are managed by randomly selected individuals who will either oversee a whole project if it has a short duration, or may oversee up to 3 years of a larger one.
Each managing representative reports to "specialism boards" staffed by their other randomly selected peers who decide which projects to prioritize and what actions within their field need to be undertaken.

Above the "specialism boards" is the government board who then decide how best to manage the interests of the Starlus as a whole.

Because of their relatively simple physical forms and their reliance on constant sources of food, the Starlus are a highly social species and tend to congregate in large underwater cities floating just beneath the surface of the oceans.
Larger cities often feature space ports at or near the surface that tend to visiting space craft including passenger transports, cargo vessels and also warships.
