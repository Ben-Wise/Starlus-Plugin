Capable of striking targets even a considerable distance away with a burst of 3 shots.The main disadvantage of this weapon though is the inability to penetrate shields making it highly ineffective against shielded targets.`

	description `The light cannon of the Starlus has seen itself mounted upon a turret for target tracking and a large field of fire on larger, slower ships which cannot make good use of their guns. To make as good use of the turret as possible, 2 cannons have been mounted and each fire in sequence for a total of 12 shots each second.`
	description `Naturally, the turreted version of the neutron cannon carries the same disadvantage as its forwards facing counterpart and is highly ineffective against shields.`
