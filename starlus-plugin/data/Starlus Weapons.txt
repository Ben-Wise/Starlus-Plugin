	description `The light cannon of the Starlus has seen itself mounted upon a turret for target tracking and a large field of fire on larger, slower ships which cannot make good use of their guns. To make as good use of the turret as possible, 2 cannons have been mounted and each fire in sequence for a total of 12 shots each second.`
	description `Naturally, the turreted version of the neutron cannon carries the same disadvantage as its forwards facing counterpart and is highly ineffective against shields.`

		description `The Pulse-Torpedo launcher is the main shield stripping weapon of the Starlus, capable of Stripping enemy shields from a considerable distance away. Each launcher fires volleys of 2 missiles each time it fires for an average rate of 1 torpedo every 1.5 seconds.`
		description `The on board guidance systems aboard the torpedo are specialized in payload delivery and can avoid most obstacles as it approaches its target, however once it is within striking distance and the torpedo is finally armed it is no longer able to dodge other obstacles.`
