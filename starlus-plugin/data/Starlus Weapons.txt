	description `The light cannon of the Starlus has seen itself mounted upon a turret for target tracking and a large field of fire on larger, slower ships which cannot make good use of their guns. To make as good use of the turret as possible, 2 cannons have been mounted and each fire in sequence for a total of 12 shots each second.`
	description `Naturally, the turreted version of the neutron cannon carries the same disadvantage as its forwards facing counterpart and is highly ineffective against shields.`

	description `The Pulse-Torpedo launcher is the main shield stripping weapon of the Starlus, capable of stripping enemy shields from a considerable distance away. Each launcher fires volleys of 2 missiles each time it fires for an average rate of 2 torpedoes every second.`
	description `The on board guidance systems aboard the torpedo are specialized in payload delivery and can avoid most obstacles as it approaches its target, however once it is within striking distance and the torpedo is finally armed it is no longer able to dodge other obstacles.`

	description "The ammo for the fearsome Foreshadow beam turret, each cartridge is essentially a supercapacitor capable of dispelling its charge into a destructive beam that is focused into a penetrating laser that can strike a target a considerable distance away. Because of the power involved, each cartridge is single use only but the blast can even damage the hull when shields are still up."
	description "Each Foreshadow turret can hold up to 960 of these."

	description `This is the ultimate weapon of the Starlus, capable of firing penetrating beams across a system to punch through even the thickest enemy armour. However, each shot has a catch: Due to the power required in an instant, each pulse of the laser beam requires 20 cartridges to store to energy required and to create the resulting beam. As a result, each shot is rather expensive at 12 thousand credits.`
	description `This turret can hold up to 960 cartridges (96 tonnes) and is the largest offensive turret in the galaxy.`
