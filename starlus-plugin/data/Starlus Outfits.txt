	description `This is the smallest of the Starlus generators. Whilst it isn't technically an active nuclear chain, it boasts power levels approaching that of a full fledged nuclear reactor thanks to the efficiency of the nuclear-organic systems that are employed within this generator.`

	description `This is the smallest active nuclear generator operated by the Starlus. It works almost like a standard nuclear reactor, but instead of heating water or another coolant which could ultimately contaminate the water the Starlus live in, it transfers all its energy to an organic mesh which turns it into a revolving magnetic field which is then turned into electricity by large induction coils.`

	description `This is considered a medium sized reactor by the Starlus, it employs the same nuclear-organic technology as its siblings. However, while this technology is very efficient at producing electricity, it does waste an awful lot of heat requiring either large heat sinks or heavy cooling.`
