	"energy generation" 3.4
	"heat generation" 4.8
	description `This is the smallest of the Starlus generators. Whilst it isn't technically an active nuclear chain, it boasts power levels approaching that of a full fledged nuclear reactor thanks to the efficiency of the nuclear-organic systems that are employed within this generator.`

	"energy generation" 9.01
	"heat generation" 16
	description `This is the smallest active nuclear generator operated by the Starlus. It works almost like a standard nuclear reactor, but instead of heating water or another coolant which could ultimately contaminate the water the Starlus live in, it transfers all its energy to an organic mesh which turns it into a revolving magnetic field which is then turned into electricity by large induction coils.`

	"energy generation" 20.2
	"heat generation" 36.2
	description `This is considered a medium sized reactor by the Starlus, it employs the same nuclear-organic technology as its siblings. However, while this technology is very efficient at producing electricity, it does waste an awful lot of heat requiring either large heat sinks or heavy cooling.`

	description `This is a large heavy duty fission reactor, designed to power the energy hungry Foreshadow turrets on their larger Warships. It generates immense amounts of heat but is very powerful for its size.`

	description `This small battery is modular, and designed to keep small to medium sized ships running whilst operating their energy intensive weapons. However, the Starlus aren't the best at battery technology and it shows.`

	description `This is a larger battery from the Starlus, designed to keep their larger ships running and to store energy before a Foreshadow strike. As with the small battery, this isn't the best technology available.`

	description `A medium sized regenerator, designed to provide medium sized Starlus warships with ample repair facilities to patch up their hull in flight. However, as with all Starlus regenerators, it is unable to recharge shields whilst the ship is under fire.`
