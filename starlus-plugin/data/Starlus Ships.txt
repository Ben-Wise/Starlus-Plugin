	description `This is a Starlus designed fighter craft, it features ample hull strength and spacious weapon space but is limited in the strength of its shields. Additionally, the Starlus do not provide their fighters with regenerators requiring them to instead return to their carrier for repairs and shield recharges.`

	description `This heavy interceptor is a powerful enemy when angered, armed with long range weapons and capable of stripping both shields and tearing through hull this little craft is not to be underestimated.`
	description `As this is the first standalone ship the Starlus designed, it is equipped with integrated pumps and machinery which allow the ship to remain cool even under intense loads. Now though, the starlus use this vessel as a scouting platform and as a surveillance platform through their region of space.`

	description `This is the first of the thorougher-bred warships developed by the Starlus when they encountered various violent species in their long storied past. This vessel has been revised several times over, each iteration more capable than the last. The vessel's current stock configuration allows it to act as a highly capable shield stripper allowing other ships dedicated to breaching hulls to engage the target safely.`
